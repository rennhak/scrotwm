Scrotwm is BSD licensed software; we prefer code that comes with a simple license
like the OpenBSD <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/share/misc/license.template?rev=HEAD;content-type=text%2Fplain">license.template</a>, and all the scrotwm-specific
code is licensed accordingly, as follows:
