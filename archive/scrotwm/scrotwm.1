.Nd window manager for X11
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm scrotwm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalistic window manager that tries to stay out of the way so that
valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
configuration.
It was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact and
fast.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts up, it reads settings from its configuration file,
.Pa scrotwm.conf .
See the

.Pa ~/.scrotwm.conf .
If that file is unavailable,
it then tries to open the global configuration file
.Pa /etc/scrotwm.conf .
.Pp
The format of the file is \*(Ltkeyword\*(Gt = \*(Ltsetting\*(Gt.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl color_focus = red
.Pp
Enabling or disabling an option is done by using 1 or 0 respectively.

.It Cm bar_delay
Update frequency, in seconds, of external script that populates the status bar.
.It Cm clock_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the clock in the status bar.  Disable by
setting to 0 so a custom clock could be used in the bar_action script.
.It Cm spawn_term
External application that gets spawned when
.Cm M-S- Ns Aq Cm Return
is used.
.It Cm dialog_ratio
Some applications have dialogue windows that are too small to be useful.
This ratio is the screen size to what they will be resized.
For example, 0.6 is 60% of the physical screen size.
.It Cm region
Allocates a custom region, removing any autodetected regions which occupy the same
space on the screen.
Defined in the format screen[<idx>]:WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y, e.g. screen[1]:800x1200+0+0.
.It Cm screenshot_enabled
Enable or disable screenshot capability.
.It Cm screenshot_app
Set to the script that will take screenshots.
It will be called with "full" or "window" as parameter 1 to indicate what
screenshot action is expected.
The script shall handle those cases accordingly.
.It Cm term_width
Set a preferred minimum width for the terminal
If this value is greater than 0,
.Nm
will attempt to adjust the font sizes in the terminal to keep the terminal
width above this number as the window is resized.
Only 
.Xr xterm 1
is currently supported.
The
.Xr xterm 1
binary must not be setuid or setgid, which it is by default on most systems.
Users may need to set spawn term to use an alternate copy of the
.Xr xterm 1
binary without the setgid bit set.
.It Cm modkey
Change mod key.
Mod1 is generally the ALT key and Mod4 is the windows key on a PC.
