Debian GNU/Linux
----------------

To run this Window Manager under Debian GNU/Linux you need to compile and install it.
This requires you to install some basic packages, which are

  o build-essential
  o libxrandr-dev
  o libxt-dev

Do this by invoking apt-get with the necessary packages as root user.
If you still get file xyz missing errors, please use apt-file.
(e.g. apt-file search Intrinsic.h)

This is a "hacker orientated" Window Manager, so don't expect to much support.
